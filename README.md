# Word-Guess-Game

<!-- What the project does: -->

This is a game of Hangman. The user has to guess the letters in the unknown, computer-generated word provided. 

As a user guesses a letter correctly, the letter replaces the letter placeholder in the word. If the user guesses a letter incorrectly, that letter is displayed in the incorrect letter section. 

The user has 10 chances to guess all of the letters correctly. If all letters in the word are correctly guessed, the user increases their wins by 1. If the user gets to 11 incorrect guesses without correctly guessing the word, the user increases their losses by 1.  

<!-- How users can get started with the project: -->

To start the game, press a letter 'a-z'. An alert will be triggered if a letter outside of the alphabet is pressed.
